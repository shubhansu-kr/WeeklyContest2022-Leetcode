// https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-297/problems/naming-a-company/

// You are given an array of strings ideas that represents a list of names to be 
// used in the process of naming a company. The process of naming a company is as follows:

// Choose 2 distinct names from ideas, call them ideaA and ideaB.
// Swap the first letters of ideaA and ideaB with each other.
// If both of the new names are not found in the original ideas, then the name ideaA 
// ideaB (the concatenation of ideaA and ideaB, separated by a space) is a valid company name.
// Otherwise, it is not a valid name.
// Return the number of distinct valid names for the company.
