// There is a street with n * 2 plots, where there are n plots on each side of 
// the street. The plots on each side are numbered from 1 to n. On each plot, 
// a house can be placed.

// Return the number of ways houses can be placed such that no two houses are 
// adjacent to each other on the same side of the street. Since the answer may 
// be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

// Note that if a house is placed on the ith plot on one side of the street, a 
// house can also be placed on the ith plot on the other side of the street.
